title: "Cotton Couture Competition 2011"
---
The garment was designed for a special client for the Cotton Couture Fashion Show 2011. Dr. Anne Porterfield and I worked together as a design team. For our inspiration we chose Raleighâ€™s natural beauty and sunset of the beach. Because our client was a middle-aged female, we designed casual suits that could showcase her elegance. Anne digitally printed the fabric and embroidered the motif. Three fit sessions were conducted with our client to ensure acceptable fit. Our design team won a cash prize in the fashion show. I could never have done this project without the help from Anne and our client. Many thanks to both of them.
