title: "Fever Monitor Hat Knitted with Thermochromic Yarns"
---
Sponsored by LSU’s Provost funds, this research is positioned to develop babies’ smart clothing for health status tracking through a pilot study of making baby thermal monitor hats. Thermochromic yarns are used to sense a baby’s forehead temperature without needing a power supply. Cotton yarns are used to build the foundation of the hat and provide basic user needs, such as comfort, moisture management, and thermal management of heads. Samples and prototypes are knitted through a 14-gauge Shima Seiki flatbed knitting machine in the department. Testings are conducted through simulated normal and fever temperature statuses of body surfaces to evaluate the sensitivity and accuracy of the developed product.
