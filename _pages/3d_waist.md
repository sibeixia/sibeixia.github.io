title: "3D Waist Level Locator"
---
Finding waist levels on 3D scans is challenging because measurement programs measure bodies non-invasively in a digital environment. However, most body measurement standards require interactions between measurers and subjects, such as bending and touching, to find accurate waist levels. This research aimed to study the relationship between 3D waist levels found by domain experts and digital landmark coordinates identified by commercial body measurement programs to develop regression models that predict waist levels on 3D scans.
