title: "Student Works - Tennis Dress Competition"
---
Sponsored by Cotton Inc., this competition is designed to promote cotton yarns’ comfort and functional features with antibacterial treatment to all students in the Department of Textiles, Apparel Design and Merchandising (TAM) at LSU through the Shima Seiki knitting systems. Because most TAM students have no knitting background, they were asked to compete in designing the motif of a given tennis dress template. A tennis dress was chosen because it fit the purpose of showcasing the application of cotton yarns and antibacterial yarns in sportswear. The shape and size of the tennis dress were pre-determined and pre-programmed in the Shima Seiki software. The winners’ designs were knitted on the Shima Seiki machine with the sponsored cotton yarns and the XT2 antibacterial yarn. Below are the sketches and final products images of the winners.
